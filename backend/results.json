    "title": "The best bites in Toronto of 2025 according to blogTO staff",
    "raw_text": "Year after year, Toronto's food scene continues to grow and flourish, and 2025 has been no exception.  For how otherwise troubling the year may have been (I'm not here to talk tariffs today or, hopefully, ever again), restaurants, both new and old, around the city kept Toronto's residents well-fed enough to forget about the bad stuff, if even just for the length of a dinner.  Though I'm lucky enough to eat around at the city's restaurants and call it a full-time job, there's only so much eating one girl can do in a calendar year. Even luckier, our office is populated with some of the city's most enthusiastic foodies, so I took to the cubicles to find out the best things they ate in 2025.  Their responses, not unlike the city's food scene, did not disappoint. But&nbsp;let's start with me.   Chicken, fries and yellow gravy, Chick-N-Joy    This one may be a hear-me-out for the ages, but I don't care, I'll die on this hill. The fried chicken at Leslieville's Chick-N-Joy is some of the best in the city, and it's made using the same recipe that the restaurant started with in the 1970s.  The chicken, fries, and even unnaturally-coloured gravy are exactly what you'd hope they'd be, and all at a price that's hard to beat these days, but if you want a more high-brow answer from me, see below.   Celeriac Wellington, PUNCH    It's hard to find a good beef Wellington, period: Gordon Ramsay has made that much clear, and even more so in Toronto.  Still, this dish at Le Germain Hotel&nbsp;Mercer's new restaurant does it right, deftly weaving Indian flavours into the quintessentially British dish, all wrapped around a perfectly rare piece of beef tenderloin. Safe to say, it'll be a favourite of mine for a long time.  Now for what my colleagues had to say...   Merluzzo Nero, Florin    \"The fish is sous vide, so it practically melts in your mouth, and it&rsquo;s served in a creamy vermouth sauce I&rsquo;d happily eat by the spoonful,\" blogTO food contributor Meagan Fava tells me.  \"It&rsquo;s topped with fried capers, which I love as someone who constantly craves salt.\"   Basically everything, Seahorse    Meaghan's favourite new restaurant in the city, she adds, is Rosedale's Seahorse.  \"Some of my top bites of the year came from here,\" she says.&nbsp;\"The Tuna Tartare is incredible, made with bluefin tuna, cr&egrave;me fra&icirc;che, and finger limes that burst with every bite. The Pear Cake was another standout. It&rsquo;s baked with cream for a super tender crumb and served warm over a heavenly caramel sauce.\"   Caribbean Style Braised Beef, Conejo Negro    Zoomer Digital Network (ZDN) Video Host Briana Brieiro tells me that her top bite of the year came from Little Italy's Conejo Negro.  \"First off, this dish looked absolutely beautiful:&nbsp;colourful and vibrant. Secondly, it tasted even better. Nothing could have prepared me for what I was about to indulge in,\" she says.&nbsp;\"It quickly became my top dish of 2025!\"   Iga Bakar Grilled Beef Ribs, Sambal      \"The meat was so tender it just fell off the bone,\" says blogTO staff photographer Fareen Karim.  \"The mix of sambal and soy sauce makes the flavour so&nbsp;addicting that there will literally be nothing left on the bone. The perfect sweet and savoury dish.\"   Donatello and Truffle Affair, Alfie's       \"Leoncini prosciutto cotto, lemon basil pesto, imported whole burrata from Italy, roasted zucchini. I've never eaten a sandwich with a whole burrata bulb inside of it, and I'm not sure I could go back,\" says ZDN Video Producer Anton Wong.    \"First time I tried this was between shoots for work, and the sourdough bread was light enough that despite eating the whole thing, I didn't feel lethargic. Worth the $22, but see if you can order ahead because the lines get long!\"   Luiz Strina, a ZDN Video Editor, agrees that Alfie's is one of the &mdash; if not&nbsp; the&nbsp; &mdash; best new restaurants of 2025, though he's partial to the Truffle Affair.  \"Everything complements each other, it's everything in a sandwich, and it's... it's from heaven,\" he says.   Ramyeon Birria, Gochu Libre    \"It was a really fun and unexpected mix of flavours,\" Mary Maliszewski, a food contributor at blogTO, says.  \"I also really liked the presentation &mdash;&nbsp;there's something really fun and playful about serving a fancy fusion dish in a disposable noodle cup.\"   Molecular hot pot, aKin    \"I think this dish speaks for itself, but creating such an iconic dish in such a unique way had me floored,\" says ZDN video host and producer Madison Schuliakewich.  \"There's a reason Executive Chef Eric&nbsp;Chong received  Michelin's&nbsp;young chef award! \"  &amp; more!   Food and drink contributor Christine Peddie had a hard time narrowing down all of the exceptional eats she tried this year, but among her standouts, she lists  Crudo 's porchetta sandwich, half roasted chicken from  The Fredrick ,&nbsp;Pappardelle all Barolo at&nbsp; Occhiolino ,  Ramen Tabetai 's signature ramen and the Beef Carpaccio at  The Lunch Lady .  Here's to even more to-die-for eats in 2026!",

    "raw_text": "We did it, Toronto! We made it through 2025. \n\n\n\n This year was anything but boring for the city, in fact, it was a rollercoaster ride filled with excitement, but of course also filled with drama.&nbsp; \n\n\n\n Despite the ups and down, Torontonians pushed through every moment and every headline, some laughed, some cried, and many asked, what’s next? \n\n\n\n While 2026 is already shaping up to be a year filled with similar moments, let’s take a look back at some of the top moments and headlines that shaped the city this year. \n\n\n\n  ROB FORD DOCUMENTARY  \n\n\n\n One of the most talked about moments this year was centred around one of the city&#8217;s most controversial mayor ever, that’s right, Rob Ford. Netflix subscribers might remember  Trainwreck: Mayor of Mayhem , a Netflix documentary focusing on the late politician&#8217;s controversial time as the city’s mayor, including scandals that are still being discussed all these years later. The documentary was not welcomed by his brother and Premier of Ontario Doug Ford who called the documentary “disgusting.” \n\n\n\n     \n         Read More \n\n         \n        \n                     \n                         ‘I can’t wait to see it,’ Canadians eager to see former Toronto mayor Rob Ford’s scandalous legacy in new Netflix documentary \n                     \n                    \n                         \n     \n\n\n\n  ROGERS STADIUM OPENING&nbsp;  \n\n\n\n This year, Toronto was given a brand new concert venue, the biggest in the entire city in fact. Rogers Stadium opened its doors with a seating capacity of 50,000 and quickly welcomed acts like Coldplay, BLACKPINK, Chris Brown, and System Of A Down! But it wouldn&#8217;t be a grand opening without grand drama, fans immediately voiced concerns over the concert&#8217;s shaky seats, long wait times to exit the venue after the shows, and even noise complaints from locals. Flooding was also an issue after it poured during night one of Chris Brown’s two-day run in August. Despite that, the venue is still here and already announcing acts for next year. \n\n\n\n     \n         Read More \n\n         \n        \n                     \n                         ‘They need to sort this out,’ Rogers Stadium concert-goers raise safety and accessibility concerns after opening night \n                     \n                    \n                         \n     \n\n\n\n  TIFF 50TH ANNIVERSARY&nbsp;  \n\n\n\n The Toronto International Film Festival returned for its big 50th birthday, and both the city and the stars showed up for a week filled with incredible films, interviews, and unforgettable red carpet moments. This year, the festival saw films like  Frankenstein, John Candy: I Like Me, Ballad of A Small Player  and many more steal the show with incredible stories and stunning reviews. Stars like Charli XCX, Jamilie Lee Curtis, The Rock, Sydney Sweeney, Matthew McConaughey, and&nbsp; more were out and about on the streets of Toronto. It was a perfect birthday for one of Toronto’s most beloved events, and the 51st edition is sure to bring a lot more memories.&nbsp; \n\n\n\n  \n     @nowtoronto   Channing Tatum thinks Toronto is dope! He&#8217;s here for the TIFF premiere of his film &#8220;Roofman&#8221; and told us what he loves most about the 6ix!  #TIFF50   #TIFF2025   #ChanningTatum    ♬ original sound &#8211; Now Toronto      \n  \n\n\n\n     \n         Read More \n\n         \n        \n                     \n                         Would you pay up to $500 to watch a TIFF premiere?

This year, upgrades began on BMO field, which will temporarily be renamed Toronto Stadium, to meet FIFA requirements for the games. These upgrades include four new 50 x 30 video boards and a new 80-person capacity lounge. Phase 2 upgrades began in December, including the installation of 17,000 new temporary seats, which will bring the stadium&#8217;s capacity from 27,000 to 45,000. \n\n\n\n  \n     @nowtoronto   BMO Field unveils latest upgrades ahead of FIFA World Cup 2026; construction for 17K seats to begin in December. ⚽️  #FIFA    ♬ original sound &#8211; Now Toronto &#8211; Now Toronto      \n  \n\n\n\n     \n         Read More \n\n         \n        \n                     \n                         BMO Field unveils latest upgrades ahead of FIFA World Cup 2026; construction for 17K seats to begin in December \n                     \n                    \n                         \n     \n\n\n\n  VYBZ KARTEL CONCERT&nbsp;  \n\n\n\n The King of Dancehall himself finally did what a lot of Caribbeans in the city thought he never would, Vybz Kartel performed live for the first time in Toronto. To add to the excitement, he performed three incredible nights in Toronto, even bringing out the Queen of dancehall, Spice, to perform their hit song “Romping Shop” on the final day, and brought out Toronto’s very own Drake on night one. This wasn’t just a concert, it was an epic cultural moment for the city’s Jamaican and Caribbean community who have longed to see the World Boss himself. \n\n\n\n  \n     @nowtoronto   Toronto fans are reacting to Vybz Kartel’s first show in the 6ix last night. 🇯🇲🇨🇦 Streets say that night one will go down as the best night, what do you think? 👀  #VybzKartel   #Dancehall   #Toronto    ♬ original sound &#8211; Now Toronto      \n  \n\n\n\n     \n         Read More \n\n         \n        \n                     \n                         ‘10 out of 10 experience,’ Vybz Kartel’s historic first concert in Toronto leaves longtime fans in awe \n                     \n                    \n                         \n     \n\n\n\n  THE WORLD SERIES  \n\n\n\n Toronto, did you hear that the Blue Jays made it to The World Series? Of course you did, the team’s legendary run this year not only shaped the city, but certainly brought the entire country together. Day after day, and week after week Canadians were on the edge of their seats as they watched the Jays do the unthinkable and make it to the World Series for the first time since 1993. Although they lost the title to the L.A. Dodgers, they won the hearts of Canadians everywhere.&nbsp; \n\n\n\n     @nowtoronto  The  #BlueJays  may have missed their shot at the  #WorldSeries  tonight, but fans are still showing love for the team and hope for next season! 💙  #WANTITALL   ♬ original sound &#8211; Now Toronto      \n\n\n\n     \n         Read More \n\n         \n        \n                     \n                         ‘You’ve united all of us,’ Canada rallies behind Blue Jays after heartbreaking World Series loss to Dodgers \n                     \n                    \n                         \n     \n\n\n\n  SPEED CAMERA DRAMA&nbsp;&nbsp;  \n\n\n\n Speed cameras were quite the talker this year, both in Toronto and all over the province. Here in Toronto there was one camera in particular that kept making headlines, that’s right, the Parkside Drive Speed camera was vandalized over and over again. The speed camera, which issued more than 66,000 tickets since 2022, was vandalized and chopped down several times this year. However, it’s something that Toronto police and the city won’t have to worry about any longer since the provincial government banned speed cameras as of Nov. 14. \n\n\n\n     \n         Read More \n\n         \n        \n                     \n                         City of Toronto says it will remove all speed cameras by end of November \n                     \n                    \n                         \n     \n\n\n\n  FINCH WEST LRT OPENING&nbsp;  \n\n\n\n The Finch West LRT finally opened! After years of delayed openings, the 11-km light-rail line welcomed passengers on Dec. 7, right before the new year, but its opening was anything but smooth, and everything but fast. Riders immediately grew frustrated over the vehicles’ slow speeds and constant stopping at red lights, the uproar grew so loud that city council quickly approved a motion by Mayor Olivia Chow to speed it up along with all LRT and streetcar lines in the city. Updates on that progress are expected in the new year. \n\n\n\n     @nowtoronto  The long-awaited  #FinchWestLRT  has finally hit the tracks, marking the first new transit line to be unveiled in  #Toronto  since 2002.

This year, we saw the team announce Sandy Brondello as its first head coach. Brondello brings 27 years of WNBA experience as a player, assistant coach, and head coach. In addition, the team also revealed their stunning jerseys which features their team’s colours, Borealis Blue and Tempo Bordeaux. Fans can expect more announcements and updates as the team gears up for their big debut in May 2026. \n\n\n\n     \n         Read More \n\n         \n        \n                     \n                         Toronto Tempo drops its jerseys ahead of 2026 season, and the internet is weighing in  \n                     \n                    \n                         \n     \n\n\n\n  EGLINTON LRT DEADLINE MISSED… AGAIN&nbsp;  \n\n\n\n 2025 has come and gone, but the Eglinton Crosstown LRT is still not in service. At one point, it really did appear as if the crosstown, which started construction in 2011, would finally open this year. Several updates by Metrolinx and the province over the summer pointed at an opening in the fall, but that did not happen. Luckily, the crosstown did complete its revenue service demonstration this year, and if Toronto is lucky, an opening in early 2026 is sounding more and more likely.   \n\n\n\n     \n         Read More \n\n         \n        \n                     \n                         Line 5 Eglinton Crosstown tests reveal it runs 20 minutes slower than expected, and riders are already fed up \n                     \n                    \n                         \n     \n The post  Toronto survived 2025, here are the headlines we’ll never forget  appeared first on  NOW Toronto .",

    "title": "Here's everything that's open on Christmas & Boxing Day in Toronto",
    "raw_text": "Trying to figure out what's open and closed around  Christmas in Toronto  can get confusing fast, especially when holiday hours vary by store and with multiple  stat holidays  in the mix.  Holiday hours in  Toronto  aren't always consistent across retailers, which can make it difficult to quickly find nearby stores that are actually open when you need them.  To help take the guesswork out of holiday planning, we've dug around to find what's open on Christmas Day in Toronto, including grocery stores, liquor stores, shopping malls and essential services, along with all the Christmas Eve and Boxing Day holiday hours you'll want to know before heading out.  What's open on Christmas Day in Toronto  Christmas Day is one of the quietest retail days in Toronto, with most major stores, malls and services closed across the city. Still, there are a small number of grocery, convenience and essential retail options that remain open on December 25 — typically with reduced or modified hours — if you need to grab last-minute essentials.  Grocery stores  Most major grocery chains in Toronto — including Loblaws, Metro, Sobeys and their affiliated banners, as well as Costco and Walmart — will be closed on Christmas Day. That said, there are still a few grocery and food options open in Toronto on December 25 if you find yourself in a bind.   Aisle 24  is a cashierless grocery chain that carries a small selection of groceries, including fresh produce. All  locations  are open 24/7, all year round, including Christmas Day. You'll just need to  download the app  and create a profile in order to unlock the door.  All   Rabba  locations  are open 24 hours a day, seven days a week, including Christmas Day.  Many  Shoppers Drug Mart  stores will also be open, selling basic grocery staples and even fresh produce at some locations. Most locations that are open will have reduced hours, either 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. or 12 p.m. to 5 p.m. Not all locations will be open, but you can find your local store's holiday hours on the  Shoppers website . The following 24-hour stores will be open 24 hours on Christmas Day as well:   Yonge & Carlton  Avenue & Lawrence  Woodbine & O'Connor  Lawrence & Dufferin  The Donway West  Yonge & Finch (North York)  Six Points Plaza (Etobicoke)  Rexdale Plaza (Etobicoke)   All six   Summerhill Market  stores in Toronto  will be open from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. on December 25.  Liquor stores  All LCBO and The Beer Store locations in Toronto will be closed on December 25, 2025.  The following  Wine Rack  locations in Toronto will be open on Christmas Day:   Yonge & Erskine — open 11 a.m. to 11 p.m.  Danforth & Glebemount — open 11 a.m. to 11 p.m.  Bloor & Spadina — open 12 p.m. to 9 p.m.  King & Bathurst — open 12 p.m. to 8 p.m.    Church & Wellesley — open 12 p.m. to 8 p.m.  5230 Dundas St. W. (Etobicoke) — open 12 p.m. to 8 p.m.    Convenience stores  in Ontario are also permitted to sell beer, wine, cider and other ready-to-drink alcoholic beverages, and many Toronto locations will remain open on Christmas Day, potentially with limited hours. Because holiday hours aren't always posted online, it's best to check with your local store before heading out.  Shopping malls  All major shopping malls in Toronto — including the Eaton Centre, Scarborough Town Centre, Yorkdale Shopping Centre, Toronto Premium Outlets and more — will be closed on December 25.  However, the   Pacific Mall   in Markham is open 11 a.m. to 8 p.m., 365 days a year.  What's open on Christmas Eve in Toronto  Christmas Eve is the last major shopping day before the holiday, and most stores across Toronto will be open on December 24 — though many operate on reduced schedules and close earlier than usual.  If you're heading out that day, it helps to plan ahead and keep early closures in mind. Here are the Christmas Eve holiday hours for major grocery stores, liquor stores and shopping malls in Toronto.  Grocery stores     Costco :  All regular warehouses open 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Costco Business Centres will be open 7 a.m. to 5 p.m.   Farm Boy:  All locations open 7 a.m. to 5 p.m.   FreshCo:  Most locations open from either 7 or 8 a.m. until 6 p.m.   Loblaws:  Most locations open 7 a.m. to 6 p.m.   Metro:  Most locations open 7 a.m. to 6 p.m.   No Frills:  Most locations open from either 7 or 8 a.m. until 6 p.m.   Sobeys:  Most locations open from either 6 or 7 a.m. to 6 p.m.   Walmart:  Most locations open 7 a.m. to 6 p.m., with a few open as late as 9 p.m. (Downsview)   Whole Foods:  The store in Yorkville will be open 8 a.m. to 7 p.m.   Liquor stores    LCBO:  Most locations open 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., with a few exceptions that are opening at 10 a.m. or closing at 5 p.m.   The Beer Store:  All locations open 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.   Wine Rack:  All locations open. Hours vary, with the earliest opening at 10 a.m. and the latest closing at 11 p.m. (Bloor & Spadina).   What's open on Boxing Day in Toronto  While Boxing Day is a statutory holiday in Ontario, it isn't listed under the province's Retail Business Holidays Act. That means retail rules are looser than on most stat holidays, allowing more stores and malls across Toronto to open.  Here's a breakdown of Boxing Day holiday hours for major grocery stores, liquor stores and shopping malls in Toronto, including which locations are open, which are closed and how hours change on December 26.  Grocery stores    Costco:  All regular warehouses open 9 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. Costco Business Centres will be open 7 a.m. to 7 p.m.   Farm Boy:   All locations will be open 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., except for the one at 5245 Dundas St. W., which will be closed.    FreshCo:  Most locations open 10 a.m. to 7 p.m.   Loblaws:  Most locations open 7 a.m. to 6 p.m.   Metro:  Most locations open 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., although a select few will be closed.

Up on the north end of Kerr Village,   Ranee’s Roti   brings Oakville the flavours of Port of Spain&#8230; stewed, chopped and folded by Ranee herself. And if you’ve ever chatted with her, you already know the food is only half the reason people keep coming back. \n     \n The doubles hit first… soft bara wrapped around channa that’s practically glowing. They arrive golden and steaming, soaked through with turmeric, cumin, and that unmistakable Trinidad warmth. Add a spoonful of Ranee’s homemade hot sauce (yes, she bottles it), and suddenly you understand why this dish is a national treasure in T&amp;T. \n     \n Then comes the curry goat: a plate that proves every shade of brown is beautiful. Dark, rich gravy. Tender chopped goat. Flecks of pepper and garlic melting into the stew. Messy, comforting, and just spicy enough to get your nose running.&nbsp; Atop white rice is the play.&nbsp; It&#8217;s the kind of lunch that puts the bite in your bark. \n And finally, the roti… soft, stretchy, and stuffed to its breaking point. You can tell a lot about a place by their potatoes. Here, the textured chunks spill out the moment you crack it open. You can still use your hands, though. You should. \n     \n   Ranee’s Roti   is one of those tiny, quietly legendary spots you don’t just “try.” You adopt it. You tell your friends. You walk out with a jar of hot sauce you didn’t plan to buy.

    "title": "Nobu for Brunch (Toronto)",
    "raw_text": "Nobu’s all-you-can-eat  Sunday brunch ($110 per person,\n$55 for children 5-12 years old)  is sprinkled throughout the second floor\nof the restaurant. As you’re guided to your table, hot food and carving\nstations line the walkway, doing a great job of whetting your appetite. Front\nand centre in the bright dining room is the sushi bar, where a team of chefs\ncontinuously turns out maki and nigiri. Off in the corner sits the dessert\ntable, with a ceviche and spicy cucumber salad ice bar tucked in for good\nmeasure.        \n\n I appreciated how the food stations are spaced out. There’s\nno dreaded bottleneck of diners waiting, nor that frantic urge to grab\neverything at once just to avoid lining up again. \n\n Chef Nobu Matsuhisa was one of the pioneers of\nJapanese-Peruvian cuisine back in the mid-90s. At the time, dishes like spicy\ntuna crispy rice and yellowtail crudo felt fresh and exciting, while miso black\ncod became a signature that kept people coming back. These are still dishes I\nenjoy, but decades later they’ve been copied endlessly, making what’s served at\nNobu feel far less groundbreaking than it once was.        \n\n If you’re going for the  miso black cod , make sure you\nget it hot. My first bite, taken from a platter that had been sitting, was\nbland and slightly fishy. A second round, straight from a freshly placed tray,\nwas noticeably better. It’s tasty, but it didn’t rank among the best miso cods\nI’ve had.        \n\n The  crispy rice station  is a great idea in theory,\nbut the execution falters. The wooden spoons make it awkward to scoop up the\nrice nuggets, and many of the serving utensils (spring-hinged chopsticks and\noversized soup ladles) are poorly suited for a buffet.        \n\n Thankfully, the  soft-serve ice cream station  sits\nright beside the crispy rice, so I grabbed a simple stainless steel teaspoon.\nIt turned out to be the perfect tool for neatly dolloping finely chopped tuna,\nsalmon, and mashed avocado onto each bite. The crispy rice itself would benefit\nfrom being thinner and longer for easier spreading and eating.         \n\n Unsurprisingly, the  sushi  was underwhelming, even\nwhen taken from freshly dropped plates. The rice was bland and too cold, though\nat least the pieces were kept small, letting the fish take centre stage. All\nthings considered, it’s better than most buffet sushi, though I usually steer\nclear of buffet sushi stations altogether.          \n\n Some of my favourite bites ended up being the unexpected\nones.  Nobu’s Greek salad  has a generous feta-to-vegetable ratio that\nleans salty but spooning it over the garden salad below helps balance things\nout nicely.        \n\n The  prime rib carving station  also drew me back for\nseconds. While the meat quality wasn’t exceptional, the variety of sauces made\nit fun to sample and customize each bite.        \n\n Despite not having a big sweet tooth, I found it hard to\nresist the dessert spread. The  pandan-laced crème brûlée and flan-like\nmatcha panna cotta  were standouts. Just do yourself a favour and skip the\ndry Earl Grey beignets.        \n\n Nobu offers something for everyone including the breakfast\nstaples of  bacon, sausage, tater tots, and eggs.  Just be warned: their scrambled\neggs are the ultra-soft, almost runny style popular in many Asian cuisines,\nwhich isn’t for everyone.        \n\n Nobu’s Sunday brunch is fun and indulgent - just don’t\nexpect to be blown away by anything. It’s worth doing once for the experience\nand is a great option for an unhurried catch-up with loved ones (they did not\nkick us out after 2 hours). Some hits, some misses, and plenty of options to\nkeep everyone at the table happy. Just make sure you grab the good stuff while\nit’s hot.          \n\n\n \n    Overall mark - 6 out of 10     \n   \n\n\n \n \n \n    How To Find Them    \n      \n \n \n    &nbsp; Location:   &nbsp; Toronto, Canada    \n &nbsp;  Address:&nbsp;  25 Mercer Street  \n \n  &nbsp;Website: &nbsp; https://noburestaurants.com/toronto/nobu-toronto       \n\n    \n     \n \n \n     \n Follow me on twitter to chat, be notified about new posts and more -  https://twitter.com/GastroWorldBlog   \n  ____________________________  \n Gastro World's Grading System   \n  \n   Anything under 5  - I really disliked and will never go back  \n   6  - decent restaurant but I likely won't return  \n   7  - decent restaurant and I will likely return  \n   8  - great restaurant that I'd be happy to recommend  \n   9  - fantastic restaurant that I would love to visit regularly and highly recommend  \n   10  - absolute perfection!  \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  Is That It?

    "title": "Tinga Kim Taqueria (Toronto)",
    "raw_text": "The staff at Tinga Kim Taqueria are so pleasant that they\nmake the experience. They’re welcoming and flexible on seating arrangements,\noffering their cute patio out back, which we were contemplating until we saw a\ntable coming back complaining about bugs.  \n\n  Being in the dingier indoor area has its benefit: such as\nthe ease of getting their attention and placing our order in three stages to\ncontrol the pace of the meal.  \n\n  We started with “appetizers” including the  K-Wings  or\nKorean style wings in both flavours. I preferred the  Oro K-wings ($20 for 6)\n the crispy chicken left neutral but having been marinated in arbol (type of\nchili pepper), soy, and oyster sauce was very flavourful. Juicy and crunchy\nthis is what makes Korean fried chicken so good.         \n\n  The  Rojo K-wings ($20 for 6)  were too strong for me:\nthe  gochujang,  ginger, soju, and oyster sauce base tasty on the first\nbite but overwhelming by the last. Rest assured, Tinga Kim doesn’t baby their\ndiners and makes these spicy.         \n\n  I’m glad we got the   quesabirria  ($18)  for the\ntable as the shredded beef saturated in consommé was so rich and salty that one\nis sufficient. They don’t skimp of the cheese so it’s nice and gooey but could\nuse more raw onion and herbs to counteract the heaviness. Strangely this\narrives with chili oil and a sour cream aioli instead of the beef consommé\nyou’d expect to dip it in. It seemed more  quesadilla  than  quesabirria .\n         \n\n  Their single order tacos are great for building your own main.\nIdeally, the chef should have left the shrimp in the   pingo Coreano  ($12)\n neutral rather than saturating it in soju, soy and oyster sauce. By this\npoint, I was getting tired of this flavour combo and was looking forward to\nwhat the menu describes as shrimp, soju-based salsa, guacamole,  cotija &amp;\nOaxaca  cheese, and cilantro. No where did it mention soy and oyster sauce,\nwhich completely covered the sparse guacamole and cheese but did help soften\nthe tostada, so it was foldable and easier to eat. I’m really reaching for the\nsilver lining here.          \n\n  The   maapo libre  ($10)  tasted the same since\nthe main protein was Korean marinated  galbi.  Except this was topped with\nan overly salted citrusy red cabbage slaw. Quite frankly, by this time I’m not\nsure what on their menu doesn’t contain soy sauce.          \n\n  After all that salt I was craving something sweet. The  Mexican\nflan ($10)  was calling and while it wasn’t terrible, if the recipe includes\nwhite chocolate in the custard they really should have left the syrup thin\nrather than dousing it in a thick caramel that brought this to cloying sweet\nlevel. Moreover, the custard became too dense. The silver lining? At least each\norder contained two mini flans that makes it perfect for sharing.         \n\n  My perception is that the chefs at Tinga Kim create one\nsauce then use it on everything. That same caramel was drizzled onto the\nalready sweet   tres leches  cake ($17) , which means yes this is\ntooth achingly sweet as well. At least the cake was nice and moist.         \n\n  Even the cinnamon sugar dusted  churros ($10)  didn’t\nescape the sauce, which needs to be served on the side. The actual pastry was a\nbit dense but at least freshly deep fried and hot.         \n\n  Writing this post really has me going back to the practice\nof gratitude journaling – amongst everything that goes wrong, what is the\npositive thing? Tinga Kim is lucky their staff are so sweet… much like all\ntheir desserts. &nbsp;   \n\n       In a nutshell...&nbsp;      Must order:  Oro k-wings   Just skip: &nbsp;pingo Coreano taco, Maapo libre taco        \n\n\n \n    Overall mark - 5 out of 10     \n   \n\n\n \n \n \n    How To Find Them    \n      \n \n \n    &nbsp; Location:   &nbsp; Toronto, Canada    \n &nbsp;  Address:&nbsp;  1182 Queen Street East  \n \n  &nbsp;Website: &nbsp; https://www.tingakimtaqueria.com/       \n\n    \n     \n \n \n     \n Follow me on twitter to chat, be notified about new posts and more -  https://twitter.com/GastroWorldBlog   \n  ____________________________  \n Gastro World's Grading System   \n  \n   Anything under 5  - I really disliked and will never go back  \n   6  - decent restaurant but I likely won't return  \n   7  - decent restaurant and I will likely return  \n   8  - great restaurant that I'd be happy to recommend  \n   9  - fantastic restaurant that I would love to visit regularly and highly recommend  \n   10  - absolute perfection!  \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  Is That It?

    "raw_text": "Happy hour menus have been making a comeback with the\nweakening economy. Planta’s menu is one of the most extensive and offers great\nvalue to boot. While beer and wine ring in at $6 and $9, respectively, it’s the\n$10 cocktails that wet my whistle. You can’t go wrong with the  lych please ,\na gin cocktail lightly sweetened with lychee, lemon, and pineapple with a\nhibiscus sugar rim that delights.  \n\n  Planta also provides a huge food offering that doesn’t skimp\non portions. With the  lettuce wraps ($12)  being half off their regular\nmenu price ($23), I expected a shrunken helping the equivalent to two or three\nwraps. So, when the full plate arrived with enough of the  gochujang  covered\ncrispy fried tofu and roasted Brussels sprouts to make seven wraps we were\nflabbergasted. Oh no, we ordered way too much food!         \n\n  The menu offers no description with the  chick’n fried mushrooms\n($7)  but they turn out to be lightly battered oyster mushrooms that’s\ndusted with salt and pepper served with a thinned sweet chili sauce. They’re\ndangerously addictive and so tasty that I could swap these for a chicken nugget\nany day.         \n\n  In a similar vein, the crust of the  cauliflower wings\n($8)  was so crispy despite not being overly battered. Drizzles of unagi\nsauce and sweet chili mayo covered the vegetables giving each bite a burst of\nflavour.         \n\n  For a lighter nibble, the  summer rolls ($6)  are an\noption. It’s just filled with a lot of carrot and rice noodles and needed more\nof the other ingredients (papaya, tofu, and herbs) to stand out.           \n\n  The  crispy rice ($9)  would work better left intact,\nso the starch doesn’t become cold and dry. At least they put plenty of the spicy\nahi watermelon   and guacamole on top to balance out the tasteless rice\nball.            \n\n  I preferred the  spicy crab hand roll ($5 each) , which\nwas stuffed to the gills with shredded hearts of palm tossed with  ponzu \nand spicy mayo. It’s more of a taco than handroll so it isn’t the easiest to eat\nbut does mean there’s little rice and tons of filling.           \n\n  The sole dish that threw us both off was the  spinach and\nartichoke dip ($11).  How can you mess up a creamy dip? By adding so much\ncoconut oil into the recipe that coconut was all we could taste. &nbsp;It felt like I was eating a savoury coconut\ncream pie with chunks of vegetables. Its only saving grace was they don’t skimp\non the tortilla chips… too bad we didn’t need more than a few each.         \n\n  Luckily, we had ordered so much food that we didn’t need the\ndip. Even without the dish, we left stuffed and with enough leftovers for\nanother meal. Washed down with two cocktails each, our bill came to about $70 a\nperson including gratuities and taxes. Welcome back happy hour dinners.    \n\n       In a nutshell...&nbsp;      Must order:  chick'n fried mushrooms, cauliflower wings, lettuce wraps   Just skip: &nbsp;spinach and artichoke dip, summer rolls        \n\n\n \n    Overall mark - 8 out of 10     \n   \n\n\n \n \n \n    How To Find Them    \n      \n \n \n    &nbsp; Location:   &nbsp; Toronto, Canada    \n &nbsp;  Address:&nbsp;  1221 Bay Street  \n \n  &nbsp;Website: &nbsp; https://www.plantarestaurants.com/location/planta-toronto/       \n\n    \n     \n \n \n     \n Follow me on twitter to chat, be notified about new posts and more -  https://twitter.com/GastroWorldBlog   \n  ____________________________  \n Gastro World's Grading System   \n  \n   Anything under 5  - I really disliked and will never go back  \n   6  - decent restaurant but I likely won't return  \n   7  - decent restaurant and I will likely return  \n   8  - great restaurant that I'd be happy to recommend  \n   9  - fantastic restaurant that I would love to visit regularly and highly recommend  \n   10  - absolute perfection!  \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  Is That It?

    "title": "Café Le Majestik 慶豐冰室 (Toronto)",
    "raw_text": "With a name like Café Le Majestik you may be picturing a\ndining room of grandeur that sparkles with magical touches. Heck, you may even expect\na French touch. In reality, you’ll find a HK café with décor that may elicit\nmemories for those growing up in Hong Kong before the turn of the century. &nbsp;These establishments were created to offer\nBritish inspired dishes tweaked for a Chinese palette and at a price point the\nmasses could enjoy. As they grew in popularity, so did their menus.           \n\n  HK cafés are known for their baked dishes; hence I had to\ntry a  classic baked pork chop in tomato sauce with fried rice ($13.99).  It’s\na bargain arriving with a bowl of overly tangy tomato borscht (adorned with\nvegetables and no beef) and a hot drink of choice. The mixed tea and coffee\ndrink was properly strong but did take a while to arrive given the solo person making\ndrinks was overrun with orders.         \n\n  The actual baked rice dish was lacking. While I enjoyed the\nthick tomato sauce and cheese, the pork chop was lukewarm indicating they\nlikely pre-fried them and assembled dishes to order by placing the meat, sauce,\nand cheese under the broiler and sliding it onto rice. I like my baked dishes\nsizzling hot where everything goes into the oven and no one would dare touch\nthe dish as it’s presented. At Majestik, touch away.&nbsp;          \n\n  Things improved with the wonton noodles, which did remind me\nof bowls I had in Hong Kong. The noodles are thin and springy with a lovely\nchewiness that’s different from those found in supermarkets. Their  four-item\nnoodle soup ($13.99)  is ideal for trying a bit of everything with two\npieces of fish ball, cuttlefish ball, fried fish cake, and meat/fish dumplings.\nWhile Majestik’s noodles were amazing, the accompaniments were passable and too\nsoft for my taste. Of the four, the fried fish cake had the most promise.         \n\n  Despite having so many broths in our meal already, I had to\ntry their  imitation shark fin soup ($5.99)  and this was the most\nimpressive. Large enough to share amongst two or three people, it’s thick and\nflavourful with a strong kick of sesame oil for an aromatic essence. With a\nfair amount of bean curd thread (the “shark fin”) and slivers of black fungus,\npork, and bamboo shoots it was hearty and hot. In a pinch, order the imitation\nsoup with another snack item and you’ll have a satisfying lunch.          \n\n  Yet, I like Majestik for dinner. They offer a choose your\nown selection available after 5pm. Although, their pricing makes no sense with\n2 dishes for $32.99, 3 for $42.99, 4 for $56.99, and 6 for $83.99. This leaves\nthe optimal selection the meal for three.        Dinner comes with a soup of the day: a hearty of pork bone,\ncarrot, and dried vegetable ( ba wong fa).  It was hot and rich,\nsurprisingly good for a complimentary bowl.                   The  traditional pan-fried sea bass  was fried until\ncrispy and covered with a brown sauce with pork slivers, mushroom, and black\nfungi. While it wasn’t my favourite, it’s flavourful and ideal for those who\nwant a fish that’s not stir fried.                   Somehow, we ended up ordering the heaviest dishes on the\nmenu. The  braised duck with  chuhou  paste and taro  arrived with\nplenty of the root vegetable filling up half the pot. Despite being left in\nlarge pieces, they were soft and fluffy, its neutral flavour complimenting the\npungent salty sauce. The duck was also braised until tender. As a warning, it’s\na strong dish, best for a table for four unless you want tons of leftovers.                   An ample portion of vermicelli comes with the  ginger and\nscallion clay pot prawns,  but you’ll want to mix it well before serving as\nthe satay sauce sinks to the bottom. Get to the prawns quickly to avoid having\nthem overcook as the claypot arrives sizzling and bubbling.&nbsp;                    With QR codes at the table to allow for self ordering, the\nrestaurant h as decent service despite the large number of tables and little\nstaff. Still, manage your expectations on how fast things arrive, it’s not as\nquick as the small well-oiled machines in Hong Kong. So be patient and take in\nthe sights of Café Le Majestik.    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n       In a nutshell...&nbsp;      Must order:  imitation shark fin soup   Just skip: &nbsp;baked pork chop rice        \n\n\n \n    Overall mark - 7 out of 10     \n   \n\n\n \n \n \n    How To Find Them    \n      \n \n \n    &nbsp; Location:   &nbsp; Toronto, Canada    \n &nbsp;  Address:&nbsp;  2900 Markham Road  \n \n  &nbsp;Website: &nbsp; https://cafelemajestikweb.wixsite.com/       \n\n    \n     \n \n \n     \n Follow me on twitter to chat, be notified about new posts and more -  https://twitter.com/GastroWorldBlog   \n  ____________________________  \n Gastro World's Grading System   \n  \n   Anything under 5  - I really disliked and will never go back  \n   6  - decent restaurant but I likely won't return  \n   7  - decent restaurant and I will likely return  \n   8  - great restaurant that I'd be happy to recommend  \n   9  - fantastic restaurant that I would love to visit regularly and highly recommend  \n   10  - absolute perfection!  \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  Is That It?

    "title": "Daimaru 大丸 (Toronto)",
    "raw_text": "If you’re heading to Daimaru, do yourself a favour, hop on Yelp\nand join the waitlist  before  leaving. It gives you an estimated seating\ntime that’s surprisingly accurate. Sadly, we didn’t know that. Sadly, we had no\nidea this feature existed, so even though we arrived at 5 p.m., we didn’t get\nseated until 7:30. If only we’d queued up from the couch first. Lesson\nlearned.  \n\n  The  AYCE premium dinner set per person ($34.99 on\nweekdays and $36.99 on weekends or holidays)  as well as a  soup base per\ntable ($19.99) . Most tables go for the classic  sukiyaki,&nbsp; that sweet\nand salty broth that seeps deliciously into everything it touches. For variety,\nwe added the  pork bone  broth, a cleaner, more neutral option that lets\nseafood flavours shine.  \n\n  After that long wait, we were  starving , so Daimaru’s\nselection of cooked items was a welcome sight. The  Nagoya-style chicken\nwings  were a hit! Sweet, salty, peppery, and lightly crisped while still\njuicy. The  beef  tataki  , thin slices of seared beef swimming in\nponzu and scallions, was another flavour bomb.            \n\n  There’s no shortage of fried bites either. The  crispy\npork  was spicy, crunchy, and generous in portion. Miles better than the  steak\ncutlet , which was a little too soft for my taste.            \n\n  Still, pace yourself... you’re here for the  hot pot! &nbsp;Daimaru’s ingredient list has a few surprises, like  garlic pork ribs  and\n beef tendon . The garlic mellows in the broth but still holds flavour,\nwhile the tendon softens quickly, turning silky and jelly-like in under ten\nminutes.         \n\n  With  six sliced meats  on the menu, it feels like the\nsky’s the limit. We stuck to crowd-pleasers (beef chuck, brisket, and\nsirloin) &nbsp; each with subtle differences, all perfect for dipping.         \n\n  Out of all the other ingredients, a few stood out. The  squid balls \nwere dense and bouncy with real bits of seafood. The  shrimp paste  had\nactual shrimp chunks that plump up beautifully when cooked, giving a great\ncontrast in texture.         \n\n  I also loved the  crispy tofu skin rolls - &nbsp;an\nunderrated alternative to noodles that soaks up broth like a dream. Oddly,\nDaimaru doesn’t offer spoons, so if you want a sip of soup, this is your best\nbet. The slotted bowls, however, are genius. They drain excess broth, so your\ndipping sauce (go for the  spicy garlic soy ) stays punchy, not watered\ndown.         \n\n  For the shabu shabu enthusiasts, Daimaru offers both raw and\n onsen eggs  for dipping. The onsen version looks raw but cracks open to\nreveal a just-set custardy yolk. It's oddly satisfying when it slips out of\nthe shell.         \n\n  The vegetable selection is generous, with a few surprises\nlike  a-choy , which you don’t often see elsewhere. I did miss watercress though, my go-to hot pot green. Still, the  king oyster mushrooms  and  black\nfungus  made up for it, both soaking up the broth perfectly.  \n\n  Whatever you do, save room for dessert. The  Hokkaido milk\npudding  topped with a peach-pineapple compote was a little on the sweet\nside but refreshingly tangy. Still, the real star was the  soft serve ice\ncream cone: &nbsp;creamy, nostalgic, and the perfect happy ending to a\ncomforting meal.            \n\n  Operationally, Daimaru runs like a well-oiled machine.\nOrders hit the table almost as soon as you submit them, the broth arrived\nwhile we were still picking ingredients. Despite the two-hour dining limit, we\nfinished comfortably in under 90 minutes, never once feeling rushed.  \n\n  By the end, I was full and already planning my next visit... this time with that Yelp waitlist trick. Daimaru hit the spot and is the kind\nof place that makes you forget the wait once that first bite of sukiyaki-dipped\nbeef hits.    \n\n       In a nutshell...&nbsp;      Must order:  beef slices, soft serve ice cream cone, chicken wing   Just skip: &nbsp;beef cutlet        \n\n\n \n    Overall mark - 9 out of 10     \n   \n\n\n \n \n \n    How To Find Them    \n      \n \n \n    &nbsp; Location:   &nbsp; Toronto, Canada    \n &nbsp;  Address:   390 Silver Star Boulevard  \n \n  &nbsp;Website: &nbsp; https://www.daimarushabushabu.com/       \n\n    \n     \n \n \n     \n Follow me on twitter to chat, be notified about new posts and more -  https://twitter.com/GastroWorldBlog   \n  ____________________________  \n Gastro World's Grading System   \n  \n   Anything under 5  - I really disliked and will never go back  \n   6  - decent restaurant but I likely won't return  \n   7  - decent restaurant and I will likely return  \n   8  - great restaurant that I'd be happy to recommend  \n   9  - fantastic restaurant that I would love to visit regularly and highly recommend  \n   10  - absolute perfection!  \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  Is That It?
